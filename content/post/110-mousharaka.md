## Project Details
Mousharaka graphic design conference was the first of its kind in Doha. Hired by VCU to execute the website for the conference, I managed client, designers and programmers.

We designed dual language interface (Arabic/English), and interfaced with online conference paper manager.

In addition to implementation, I arranged secure hosting for the site.
